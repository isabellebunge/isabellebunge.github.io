I am a Postdocoral Fellow in the Dee Laboratory at Rice University, Department of Earth, Environment and Planetary Sciences. My research focuses on the relationships between environment and human health outcomes with the goal of creating tools to best inform public health decision making under a changing climate. 

My current work spans from investigating the impact of environmental changes on viromes to the implications of more frequent exposure to humid heat. To see more information on my postdoctoral activites, please see the Project page.
