	abstract = {Surface winds and precipitation over the tropical oceans are related to sea surface temperature (SST) through multiple mechanisms. Greater SST is associated with greater conditional instability, which in turn is more conducive to deep convection. The associated mass and flow responses can extend to the surface, via associated pressure gradients imprinted on the top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL). SST also influences surface pressure and wind directly through its control over PBL temperature, as explained by Lindzen and Nigam. The authors examine the relative magnitudes of these two influences over the eastern tropical Pacific on subseasonal precipitation variability during northern summer, when and where SST gradients are largest and the direct influence via PBL temperature is expected to be strongest. Geopotential at 1000 hPa is partitioned into two components: the geopotential at the PBL top (the PBL top is chosen to be 850 hPa, supported by an analysis of the vertical structure of geopotential and temperature) and the PBL thickness. These fields are composited on quintiles of daily ITCZ precipitation both with and without a high-pass filter that isolates subseasonal time scales. The PBL thickness varies little between the highest and lowest precipitation quintiles, while the PBL top geopotential varies much more. This supports a view in which the direct contribution of SST to the surface pressure and flow fields, including the associated PBL convergence over sharp SST maxima, can be viewed as a steady forcing on the rest of the column, while free-tropospheric transients contribute most of the variability associated with precipitation on subseasonal time scales.},

	abstract = {Studying convection, which is one of the least understood physical mechanisms in the tropical atmosphere, is very important for weather and climate predictions of extreme events such as storms, hurricanes, monsoons, floods, and hail. Collecting more observations to do so is critical. It is also a challenge. The Organization of Tropical East Pacific Convection (OTREC) field project took place in the summer of 2019. More than thirty scientists and twenty students from the United States, Costa Rica, Colombia, México, and the United Kingdom were involved in collecting observations over the ocean (east Pacific and Caribbean) and land (Costa Rica, Colombia). We used the NSF NCAR Gulfstream V airplane to fly at 13-km altitude sampling the tropical atmosphere under diverse weather conditions. The plane was flown in a “lawnmower” pattern and every 10 min deployed dropsondes that measured temperature, wind, humidity, and pressure from the flight level to the ocean. Similarly, over the land, we launched radiosondes, leveraged existing radars, and surface meteorological networks across the region, some with collocated global positioning system (GPS) receivers and rain sensors, and installed a new surface GPS meteorological network across Costa Rica, culminating in an impressive systematic dataset that when assimilated into weather models immediately gave better forecasts. We are now closer than ever in understanding the environmental conditions necessary for convection as well as how convection influences extreme events. The OTREC dataset continues to be studied by researchers all over the globe. This article aims to describe the lengthy process that precedes science breakthroughs.},
